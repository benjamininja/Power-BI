# Power-BI
Holding Power BI development files build to help manage league needs as well as benefit fantasy team managers such as myself (I want all rookie information as they are REALLY important assets).


**Power BI Service, Fantasy Football Workspace** - I've stopped doing this but the work here is used to enhance a salary league as well as providing a rookie player analytical reports for dynasty leagues. Much fun.

**14-Team, 2022 Resign Salary Generation** - Last updated resign valuation determined by average of top 5 cap hit salary contract values by position group. This value is then weighted against two season's worth of player production. This report is the end result breakdown for a 14-team league for resign analysis.

**2021 Rookies; 2022 Rookies** - 2021 report has more UI thought and effort while the 2022 report is an attempt to identify market valuation shifting over time by adding a pre/post combine. The NFL combine can create a large shift in perceived valuation based on performance. Had this project carried on, the third phase/tab would have been post-draft. The purpose of this work is to provide a more complete information set. This is achieved by providing the ability to look across different market inflection points to identify potential efficiencies (value has dropped due to combine performance and/or where drafted, increase in valuation due to strong combine performance, etc). This is meant to be used in conjunction with film and NOT as a replacement.
